## Runiq's dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. Feel free to copy and paste as you see fit.

## Disclaimer

I don't assume liability for any of these files. If you copy and paste and one of the files eats your hamster, you're on your own.

If I have left out a license or improperly attributed something and you want that fixed, drop me a line.

## Dots

These dotfiles are organized by using [dots](https://github.com/EvanPurkhiser/dots). Those in the `base` directory are installed by default. The files in the `common` and `machines` subdirectories complement and sometimes extend those in the `base` directory. They are only installed on the machines which have the correct "groups" set.

For example, my home laptop has the tags `machine/caballo` (its hostname) and `common/python` (because I do some Python coding with it). My work notebook has `machine/trabajo` and `common/latex`.

## Note

My [old dotfiles repo](https://bitbucket.org/runiq/dotfiles-old) is still available and doesn't use dots. It will not be maintained anymore.
